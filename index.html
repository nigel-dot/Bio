<br>
        <p>Coming from a background of software engineering ,  I have had much experience in problem solving , understanding and working with technology  
        and having owned various businesses, some of them being startups has given me a wealth of varied customer experience , leading teams and the ability to deal with clients , understanding that ROI is important to businesses.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I like to think outside the box in order to create solutions that enable the user to better engage with a product and am always researching new techniques to achieve this.</p>
        <p>I enjoy and see the value in collaborating and consolidating ideas with other people which has led to successful team projects and presentations.</p>
        <br>
